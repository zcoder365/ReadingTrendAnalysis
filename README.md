Analyzing reading platform trends to understand user behavior and market dynamics across different platforms.

## Projects

### 📚 [Goodreads Trends (2020-2025)](./goodreads/)
Analysis of rating patterns, genre popularity, and user engagement across 1,200 books from Goodreads' most popular lists (2020-2025). Read the full report [here](./goodreads/Goodreads_Reading_Trend_Analysis.pdf).

**Key Findings:**
- **66% engagement decline** from 2022 peak (58.7M ratings) to 2025 (20.1M ratings), suggesting platform migration
- **Romance & fantasy dominate** publication volume (283 and 275 books respectively), alternating yearly in popularity
- **Quality paradox**: highest-rated genres (business 4.39★, memoir 4.27★) represent <6% of top lists, while most popular genres (romance, fantasy) average lower ratings
- **2022 anomaly**: "review bombing" incidents temporarily spiked engagement while deflating average ratings

**Visualizations:** See [`/visualizations`](./goodreads/visualizations/) for all graphs. Note: some detailed visualizations (like genre trends over time) are best viewed at full size.
