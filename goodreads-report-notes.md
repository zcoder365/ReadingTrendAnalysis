## Page 1: Executive Summary
- Keep to 1/2 page max
- General overview of report

## Page 2: Methodology
- Talk about:
    - Data source
    - Metrics analyzed
    - Tools and technologies
    - Data processing
    - Limitations (e.g., represents Goodreads data only, genre generalization (only took the first genre in the list), audiobook data stops at 2024, data stops at top-read/popular books)

## Page 4-10: Findings
- One finding per page or two
- Insert graphs before text/description of findings + label graphs as "Figure X" (where X is a number)
- Structure (repeat for each major finding):
    - FINDING 1: [TREND NAME]
    - Figure X (with figure attached)
    - Analysis
    - Potential explanations
- Potential findings:
    1. Platform-wide rating decline
    2. Genre dominance and evolution
    3. The 2022 engagement spike (no. ratings)
    4. Genre quality patterns
    5. Market concentration
    6. Engagement by genre

## Page 11: Anomalies and Data Quality
- Data quality notes, e.g., audiobook genre gap
- Insert note about any other data quirks
- Impact these had on the data (i.e., how does it affect my conclusions?)

## Page 12: Conclusions
- Note key patterns (e.g., reader behavior evolution (like readers becoming more discerning over time), genre preference shifts, engagement patterns, quality vs popularity)

## Page 13: Future Work
- Platform comparison (comparing Goodreads to Fable and/or StoryGraph)
- Demographic analysis (if it becomes available)
- Temporal deep dive (looking into seasonal patterns, release timing impacts, monthly trends, etc.)
- Audiobook investigation (resolve audiobook data gap, analyze audiobook trends compared to traditional books)
- Predictive modeling (develop models to predict future genre popularity or rating trends based on historical data/patterns)

## Final Page: Appendix (Optional)
- Additional visualizations (any graphs I didn't use)
- Data sources (listing specific URLS)
- Code repository (link the GitHub repo)
